1. Sets the number of columns a cell should span - so basically tells the browser that this table has three columns.
2. HTML: center align (text is aligned at center), colspan 3 (with three columns), and bold (text is bold). CSS equivalents are text-align, colspan and font-weight bold.
3. HTML source only has the HTML, and references CSS separately. DOM inspector links in the CSS and identifies each div as well as its applied styles. Use the DOM inspector to figure out the structure of the web page and the styling of each element; HTML source to inspect the overall flow of the webpage - what is triggered, and when.
